# Welcome to CakePHP API Plugin

## What is the API plugin?

The API plugin offers you all tools you need to create an RESTful API with the CakePHP framework.
It's built on top of proven technologies:

- [CakePHP 3.x](http://cakephp.org/)
- [League/Fractal](http://fractal.thephpleague.com/)
- [CRUD](http://crud.readthedocs.io/)

## Goals

- Use proven technologies, so don't reinvent the wheel
- Do as much as possible for the developer, but keep maximum customizability
- Work with standards like HAL and JSON-API but also allow custom serialization
- Support the pagination of data results, for small and large data sets alike
